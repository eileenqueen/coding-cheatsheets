quick references for various coding languages

Welcome to Eileen's Coding Cheatsheets!
=================================================

Hi, world!  I'm Eileen, like that song from the eighties (yes, I've heard it before).  I'm just discovering the enthralling, multi-faceted world of coding, and so far, I am _loving_ every second of it!

With so many different paths to take and languages to learn, I was a little overwhelmed about where to start.  I chose html on a whim (remembering those good ol' days when I used to make my own user page layouts on Neopets...anyone else?), and then started dabbling in CSS, and then learned about The Command Line and bash scripting, and then decided to hop into Ruby...

So, yeah, I've got fingers in a lot of different pies.

As I started learning multiple languages at one time, I began to worry about how I was going to keep track of them all.  I was also wondering about what kind of projects I could develop with my extremely limited experience.  I decided to kill two birds with one stone by using my newfound programming skills to make cheatsheets for the languages I'm working with! 

And here we are.

My current projects include:

  * [HTML](https://github.com/eileenqueen/coding-cheatsheets/blob/html/html.html) 
  * [C Language](https://github.com/eileenqueen/coding-cheatsheets/blob/html/clang.c)
  * Markdown ~~if you count this README page, which I just learned Markdown to make~~

My upcoming projects include:

  * Ruby
  * Bash Scripting
  * CSS
  * And any other languages I decide to learn!

This is a personal project, but if you are new to coding, feel free to use my notes!

If you're an old hat, please let me know if you've noticed any errors.  Constructive criticism is always welcome!
