        <p>Hello!  Welcome to my Web Design Cheat Sheet, where I'm compiling 
            all of the information I've learned about coding with HTML and CSS
            through CodeCademy.  You can't see it if you're viewing this as a
            webpage, but this document is riddled with all sorts of comments to 
            keep me on track!  Or I could just narrate as I go, and show you
            and myself how to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em>
            things.
            <br>
            Does this look like a different paragraph?  I just added a line break,
            so it should!
        <!--Paragraph text is enclosed in the <p></p> tags-->

        <!--As always, this is a work in progress!  Check back soon for updates!-->
